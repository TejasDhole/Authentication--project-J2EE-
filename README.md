🚀 Exciting News: Just Completed my J2EE Authentication Project! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a comprehensive authentication project that includes a login page, registration functionality, and a user-friendly home page. This project has been an incredible journey, and I'm excited to highlight some of the key features:

## Key Features

🔐 **Login Page**: Implemented a secure login page where users can enter their mobile number and password for authentication. Leveraged Servlets and JSP for server-side logic and a seamless user experience.

📝 **Registration**: Designed a user-friendly registration process, allowing new users to sign up by providing their personal information. Backend validation and database integration were key components.

💼 **Home Page**: After successful login, users are greeted with a personalized home page. Utilized JDBC and MySQL to fetch user data from the database and display it on the front end. HTML, CSS, and J2EE technologies were used to create an engaging user interface.
